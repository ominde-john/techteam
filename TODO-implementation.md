# Showcase Section Implementation TODO

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Create `src/components/home/ShowcaseSection.tsx` with array of 10 showcase items (React, GitHub, Firebase, Flutter, Node.js, VS Code, Linux, Cloudflare, Supabase, OpenAI), staggered grid layout, alternating left-right alignment, white background, rounded corners, subtle shadows, and generous spacing using placeholder images.
- [x] Edit `src/pages/Index.tsx` to import ShowcaseSection and add it after AboutSection.
- [x] Update `TODO-showcase.md` to mark the creation and import steps as completed.
- [ ] Run dev server to test layout, responsiveness, and image loading.
- [x] Verify the staggered alignment, premium feel, and adjust spacing/shadows if needed.
